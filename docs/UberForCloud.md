## Introduction  

Cloud market today resembles the Computer market before Personal Computers. 

It was dominated by big hardware companies IBM, Dec, HP. In the Cloud market today, AWS, Azure and GCP (so called Hyperscalers) rein, and like in the pre-PC era, the systems of Hyperscalers are incompatible, and the scale of independent Data Centers is too small to compete with the Hyperscalers.

What we are missing is the Uber for Data Centers. Tradle will unify Data Centers by helping them run Personal Cloud, a new market segment, not pursued by Hyperscalers. 

Like MS DOS was for PCs and Android is for mobiles, Personal Cloud is the next cycle of Personal Computing. Combined with Uber-like marketplace to place Personal Cloud in one of the enabled data centers, it creates a ground for explosive growth. Every European citizen will get a Personal Cloud as an extension to their mobile phone. Personal Cloud will run Personal Apps that hold data in Europe, with data that **can’t be accessed by anyone,** but that person.

**Network effect** is increasing with more Personal Clouds coming online for use by Federated AI. Network effect will also emerge as is common in any marketplace. 

**Market conditions** today are conducive for this market to emerge in Europe, as Europe is fighting to keep the data locally, in custody of EU companies.  \

5. EU Data Center market already greatly [benefited from the GDPR](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-data-center-market-in-europe-by-investment-to-around-44-billion-during-the-period-2020-2025---market-research-by-arizton-301025624.html)
6. European culture of personal values and federated business 

Eastern Europe, starting with Slovakia, is poised to lead the Personal Cloud market.

**Conducive conditions in Slovakia**



*   [Slovakia's anti-corruption fight](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/03/02/slovakia-wakes-up-to-a-new-era-without-fico/) is a match to Tradle’s blockchain Cloud e-government. 
*   Slovakia’s new government has set sights on healthcare, a match for Personal Cloud.
*   Imagine every Slovak getting a Personal Cloud when accessing e-gov & Telco services.
*   [Slovakia can support its Data Centers](https://datacentercatalog.com/slovakia) expansion with its [robust supply of electricity](https://www.seas.sk/slovak-energy-sector).
*   [IPM’s infra-tech thesis](https://www.ipmllp.com/sectors/growth/) and portfolio are synergistic to the Personal Cloud proposition.

**Market Beyond Europe: **Due to the proliferation of Data Sovereignty / Residency laws, a similar market can emerge in Asia & LATAM.


### Achieving scale 

There were 500,000 commercial Data Centers worldwide in 2011, and they came under tough competition with the Hyperscalers. Data Centers joining forces collectively can achieve Scale via unification of the Cloud Infrastructure Layer combined with a market for purchasing their resources.



![alt_text](/img/ufc-revenue.png "image_tooltip")



### Historical precedent 

Below are 2 examples when collective scale allowed small entities to compete with the giants:



1. **Microsoft for PCs. **MS DOS unified thousands of PC manufacturers. It did not matter much who you bought the PC from, as long as it ran MS DOS (and later Windows). This enabled a burst of innovation in PC hardware.  \

2. **Android for Mobiles. **Android unified dozens of phone makers and allowed new ones to arise. It does not matter whether you have a Samsung phone today, tomorrow you can switch to OnePlus, LG or Huawei.




## Enabling the market for cloud resources 

What is required for market to become operational:



1. Like Uber, choosing a particular Data Center where to launch a new Personal Cloud. 
2. Cloud needs to be simplified as Commodity 
    1. Standardization to commoditize cloud resources
    2. Simplification of billing (similar to Serverless model with just 1 variable - amount of RAM, and of course, the usage time)
    3. Unifying Light IaaS layer that Data Centers adopt to participate in the exchange
3. Resource utilisation accounting (with the help of the blockchain for auditing)
4. Billing and collection of payments (likely with stable crypto, like DAI and the credit cards)
5. Later, a mobility across providers will be added. This will ensure a fair competitive environment, like was in the past enforced by the regulators in banking, telecom and energy.


## Market Plan 


### Personal Cloud 

We start with the market segment that is nascent, Personal Cloud, and become the dominant player in this segment. We assemble a limited IaaS unification layer, sufficient to run Personal Cloud (a paper on this layer can be provided upon request).

The next step will be SME Cloud. 


![alt_text](/img/ufc-pc.png "image_tooltip")



### Jump starting the development community  



1. Publish the app themes - a mission statement on what app categories we are seeking
2. Publish a list of apps we envision for Personal Cloud
3. Run a competition with 5 grand prizes, a €100K investment in a winning startup. This competition jump starts the Venture Studio focused on Personal Cloud apps. 
4. Series of hackathons to find new app ideas


## Why now? 


### Inclusion  

Despite the significant penetration of smartphones, large portions of the population still make do with the feature phones, use underpowered cheaper smartphones, and share smartphones among family members. 

Personal Cloud will allow all those people to get an equal amount of Private Cloud resources. 

This is important for e-government full population coverage, healthcare and financial inclusion.


### Growing Big Tech backlash

Governments in EU, US, [UK](https://www.shearman.com/perspectives/2020/07/cma-signals-new-path-for-uk-clamp-down-on-big-tech), AU have greatly increased regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech.



1. [EU started in 2020 a new phase in competition evaluation](https://www.ft.com/content/f7b13372-3797-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4) to rein in the Big Tech
2. July 2020 [US antitrust Congressional hearings](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony) on Amazon, Facebook, Apple & Google
3. US FTC in 2018 fined Facebook [$5B for privacy violations](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/07/ftc-imposes-5-billion-penalty-sweeping-new-privacy-restrictions)
4. EU fined Google in 2019 with [€1.47B for abuse ads practices](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_1770), and in 2017 €2.4B  for abusive ads practices, 
5. EU fined Google in 2017 with [€2.4B for antitrust violation ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google)with search and Android.


### European Cloud Independence 

Initiated by German government and supported by German and French Telcos (Deutsche Telekom and [Orange](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Videos/20200612-gaia-x-orange.html)), and the Data center operators like OVH, the [initiative called GAIA-X](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/gaia-x-cloud-services-to-promote-european-sovereignty/) aims for European Cloud independence from the US and China.


### Increasing Data Residency requirements  

Governments worldwide increasingly forbid Public sector and essential services (infrastructure) to run in Data Centers that are not within the country borders. It will take a number of years before hyperscalers are able to address that with the combination of building local Data Centers and Private Cloud, like AWS Outposts. Even then, the attitude of the market and the government is that the data will eventually end up in the US (due to Cloud Act) or China (due to outsized influence of Chinese government on Chinese Cloud providers: Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei). 


### Opportunity of Data Privacy Regime

Europe’s Data Regime is a competitive jurisdictional advantage for Personal Cloud. It is a unique opportunity for Europe to catch up and get ahead of US and Asian cloud providers. 

This will give local data centers a unique competitive advantage. 

This will attract new types of apps and allow the innovation ecosystem to flourish. 


### Network effect of AI on Personal Data 

**AI market size**. The global artificial intelligence (AI) market size was valued at $27B in 2019 and is projected to reach [$266B by 2027, growing at 33.2%](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/artificial-intelligence-market-100114). It is quickly rising to understand the world around us, like in eKYC, self-driving cars, [healthcare](https://readwrite.com/2020/03/15/decoding-the-future-trajectory-of-healthcare-with-ai/), [human speech](https://www.spixii.com/blog/the-future-of-voice). Just recently, AI, called GPT3, [read all of the World Wide Web](https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential) and showed it can answer search queries - a possible Google replacement in the future.

**AI is starved for data**, as most data is not public and the rest is in the hands on Big Tech. 

Hence independent AI developers lack data to train their models, which greatly limits the speed and the diversity of innovation. This can be addressed by Federated AI in Personal Cloud. Federated AI allows training models without centralizing data, and thus without letting developers see the data. Devs can pay on Cloud Market for their AI models to access data.

**Network effect**. Personal Cloud democratizes AI, allowing AI startups to compete with Big Tech. As more Personal Clouds come online, AI models gain more data to train on, achieving unprecedented quality. 


### Immediate danger of AI and Big Tech 

Big Tech is dominating the AI market with billions of users’ records. By creating a visiting AI protocol on Personal Cloud, Tradle restores a fair competitive landscape. Europe’s Legal requirements for Data Protection (GDPR) and the recent [Data Residency](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/) EU court ruling create a unique time-sensitive opportunity for local data AI.


### COVID-19 Supply Chain restructuring 

COVID-19 and US-China trade war have started the “bringing supply chains closer” shift. Cloud is an infrastructural industry that many other industries depend on, hence there is a strong sentiment that it needs to become more domestic. European GAIA-X initiative is one of the indicators of this shift. 


### Critical tech for Data Center commodity 



1. **Compute** is being [standardized with Serverless](https://fauna.com/blog/comparison-faas-providers) by a dozen new providers.
2. **Network**. Software Defined Network has a mature [OpenStack implementation](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/rocky/admin/)
3. **Store**. AWS S3-compatible Object Store, is available from [Open Stack CEPH](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/mimic/radosgw/)
4. **Databases**. [Big Data Databases](https://prestosql.io/docs/current/connector/hive-s3.html) and [new Databases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05837) emerge on top of Object Store.
5. **Search**. Google-like search can [now be part of stack](https://www.morling.dev/blog/how-i-built-a-serverless-search-for-my-blog/).


## Why Tradle? 

Unique idea that creates a new market category - Personal Cloud.

Unique idea that allows local Data Centers to compete with hyperscalers. \
_(a paper on the current state of Data Center industry can be provided upon request)._


### Availability now



1. Tradle has been developing a MyCloud concept (superset of Personal Cloud) for 3 years now and has significant product availability and the depth of expertise
2. Uniquely combining Federated AI, Blocckchain and 3rd generation Cloud 
3. 3rd generation Cloud is best suitable for the commodity market 


### Our unique capabilities that are key to this business 



1. **Data**. Tradle is built on the principles of non-aggregation and full Data Custodianship by the owners of the data from the ground up. 
2. **Identity**. Identity is the core part of our offering and it is essential to accessing cloud resources. Unification of identity and access is a prerequisite for the market to operate smoothly. 
3. **Audit**. Audit trail for any claims and their verifications is the core part of our offering. And it is essential to the market's ability to assess the validity of cloud providers’ claims of capacity and quality.
4. **Accounting** for the usage of resources is key to billing. 
5. **Universal front-end **(Transactional Messenger) is key to rapid ramp up of new apps. 
6. **App Store**. Transactional Messenger uniquely allows Tradle to get out of the duopoly Apple’s and Google’s app stores to create its own Cloud App Store.


### Role of the blockchain in Tradle 

Tradle technology stack was built from the ground up on the use of the blockchain, which is a critical component of Personal Cloud. Role of blockchain:



1. Data validity audit for Federated AI to trust the data
2. Decentralized exchange (selling and buying of cloud resources)
3. Usage Accounting (usage of cloud resources, usage of data, usage of apps)
4. Quality Audit (assurance for commodity grade levels)
5. Security Audit (access, roles, mobility between data centers, recovery)
6. Transactional Messaging
    1. For managing Personal Cloud 
    2. For access to regulated services and e-government
7. Payments (optionally)


## Channels 

**Stage one**: create enough demand to jump start the market on cloud exchange.


### Telcos 

Telcos mostly ceded the cloud market to Hyperscalers, and it is their chance to gain leverage and offer value added services. 

Specifically, every Telco has an obligation to do KYC, which is more difficult in COVID-19 limiting in-person visits to Telco stores. This is how it will work - customer downloads the app, gets through eKYC and is then given access to cellular network. Along with it comes a **free Personal Cloud** with certain limits, e.g. 1M compute units and 5G storage. Commercially this is a freemium model used by Dropbox, Apple iCloud and others. At today’s storage costs $5 a month buys 250GB of s3. So, if only 1 out of 25 signs up for the premium Personal Cloud, the costs will be covered.


### e-government 

Give every citizen in one particular country, e.g. Slovakia (or Czechia, Croatia, etc.) a Personal Cloud, enabled with 5 initial e-government services. This creates a demand for cloud resources that can be purchased on the market. Initial suppliers could be 3-5 local data centers in that country. 


### Energy companies 

Data Centers are their growing customer base. Due to this synergy, Energy companies can promote Personal Cloud, by offering a Tradle app as a mechanism for customers to track residential energy consumption, pay for these utilities, and use Utilities bill as an address confirmation for KYC with the financial sector and Telcos. Etc.


### Schools and Colleges 

Students need a place to keep their data related to studies, issuing credentials, and exam results 


## Partners 


### Commodities Exchange 

Perhaps, [Commodity Exchange in Slovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Exchange_Bratislava)


### Linux Distribution  

Any independent Linux distribution is a potential partner. For example, Canonical. Canonical is the Ubuntu Linux Distribution vendor. Ubuntu is the most popular Linux in AWS but in the Startup market it is quickly losing ground to Amazon Linux (used in AWS Lambda and Fargate) and to Red Hat in the Enterprise market. Canonical needs a new playbook. 


## Cloud Apps 

**Unlike mobile and web apps today, Personal Cloud Apps return to the privacy model of the PC era - you keep your data to yourself. **


### Cloud Apps extend mobile (and web) apps with unique capabilities

Apps are complementary to mobile apps, leveraging Cloud’s strength: \




1. **No power constraints**, while mobiles need to carefully battery, and be recharged
2. **Unlimited and reliable storage**, a constant issue on mobiles.
3. **Always-on**. Cloud is always up and running, while mobile can be out of juice, not connected, web apps go away when tab closes or PC goes to sleep (e.g. laptop lid is closed). A whole class of [local-first apps](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=local-first-apps) can’t be built without it. Imagine a P2P Google Doc equivalent that becomes unavailable to your peers when you go to sleep.
4. **AI capabilities. **AI in the cloud now employs powerful specialized hardware, and it evolves rapidly. 
5. **Reliable networking**. Network on mobiles changes in speed and cuts off.
6. **High-bandwidth network**. A whole class of apps need it, e.g. streaming, smart cars / homes, e-health, etc.
7. **Speed of change. **Cloud can change constantly, your mobile and PCs - only once in several years.
8. **Public IP address**. This enables direct connections between peers in P2P applications, otherwise constrained by home routers and mobile carrier’s neworks (necessitating complex NAT traversal, which is not very unreliable). Examples are video chat, live streaming, file sharing, blockchains, and other P2P scenarios. 


### Cloud Apps are easier to create 

Production and launch of Cloud apps are facilitated by:



1. **Built-in Digital Identity** for people and companies. Many applications require it. 
2. **Built-in Payments.** Apps need this to be monetized. 
    1. **Micropayments (later)**. Micropayments can be implemented with Bitcoin Lightening or a lottery system, like [Randpay](https://medium.com/@emer.tech/randpay-6a028f16c82a) and a similar, used by [Orchid](https://medium.com/@gustav.simonsson/ethereum-probabilistic-micropayments-ae6e6cd85a06), and [Livepeer](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/how-are-livepeers-probabilistic-micropayments-holding-up-with-these-ethereum-high-gas-prices/1127/3).
3. **Novel front-end**, which we call Transactional Messenger. Apps that use Transactional Messenger do not need to produce custom UI, which is a huge expense in any app production.
4. **Built-in Reliable database**. Use it and stop worrying about its backup and scaling.
5. **Built-in Reliable filesystem**. Use it and stop worrying about its backup and scaling.
6. **‘Quick apps’**. We offer a way to produce a large class of apps without coding. 


### Roadmap  

To enable creation of a large amount of such apps we will: 



1. **Produce an initial amount of apps** ourselves. We will focus on porting existing Open Source apps to Personal Cloud. 
2. **Create tools** for third-party developers 
3. **Establish a Venture Studio** to attract talent and invest in most promising apps.


### Potential Killer Apps 

Every platform needs apps that make it attractive. Here is the list of candidates:



1. **Personal Backup **
    1. **For mobiles. **Create an option to switch Android, iOS backup away from Google and Apple, giving every person a backup in their own country / region in Personal Cloud.
    2. For laptops and desktops. 
2. **Vault for important Files** (like Dropbox).  
    3. Backup for WhatsApp Contacts, and other apps. 
    4. Documents, things I do not want to lose, e.g. IDs, diplomas, professional licenses, - all verified and certified (utilising eKYC)
    5. Password Manager (file store for the password file)
    6. My possessions for insurance claims (synergy with big-ticket purchases)
    7. Browser data (both Chrome and Firefox offer this today but these sensitive things belong to Personal Cloud)
        1. Bookmarks 
        2. Browsing history
        3. Settings 
3. **Personal Budgeting App \
**Actual is a super fast [local-first app](https://jlongster.com/joining-stripe). It has a design that is very instructive of how local-first apps can be built.
4. **E-government and credentialing**
    8. Remote, digital identity-enabled, digital signature enabled applications for government services, registrations, licenses certification
    9. Ability to share received documents with other public and private entities
    10. Managing Government Registries on a principle of offline verification
5. **COVID-19**
    11. Gathering data from hospitals with blockchain, see [new system in the US](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/07/24/us-health-department-chief-discloses-functioning-blockchain-project-to-track-covid-19/#1e12fb741949).
    12. [Test kit’s authenticity](https://rfid.averydennison.com/en/home/about-us/newsroom/NFC-and-blockchain-to-guarantee-authenticity-of-COVID-19-test-kits.html) and test results proofs and transferability. 
    13. Infection spread tracking, without privacy violation and surveillance, with blockchain & Personal Cloud.
6. **e-Health & Longevity. **Healthy aging will [become the biggest industry in the world](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/12/07/ai-will-drive-the-multi-trillion-dollar-longevity-economy/#42eec5724965). Developed world has an enormous problem with [shrinking and aging populations](https://www.longevityinternational.org/appglongevity). In the European Union, the working-age population is projected to fall from **333 million** in 2016 to **[292 million in 2070](https://www.icf.com/insights/social-programs/aging-population-in-europe)**. Meanwhile, the share of people aged 65 and over will rise from 19% to 29% of the population, and people aged 80 and over will increase from 5% to 13%. A number of biotech breakthroughs are promising an increased healthspan. To facilitate we can start with the following apps:
    14. Clinical trials protocol development and compliance
    15. Clinical trials participants recruitment
    16. e-consultation with doctors (chat and video calls)
    17. Feedback loops: 
        4. At-home lab tests (DNA, saliva, blood, urine)
        5. Body monitoring: blood pressure, blood oxygen, EKG, glucose, sleep, activity, [odors](https://transmitter.ieee.org/electronic-nose-technology/), and other measurements
        6. Analyze and alert to abnormalities
        7. Dietary and supplementation monitoring
        8. Exercising and meditation
    18. Links to _vitamins and supplements_ related to “my results”
7. **Voice assistants** like Alexa, Siri are extremely popular. Yet they are especially privacy sensitive. They are listening to all we say inside our homes, and may send all that data to their vendor, often outside of country borders.  \
We will use Open Source that is easily verifiable, like [MyCroft](https://opensource.com/article/20/6/mycroft) and [Firefox Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/firefox-voice/). Specialized Assistants are usually better, as Alexa has shown. Assistants are good for these industries:
    19. Hospitality 
    20. Legal, see [an example](https://donotpay.com/).
8. **Monitoring and tracking. **If not done via a Personal Cloud it creates a possibility for mass surveillance. Commercially, this is a new base for the Home, Health, Life, Vehicle **Insurance**.
    21. **Fitness trackers. **
    22. **Home and car**. Automation and data for door lock, in-home and in-car video surveillance, sensors (e.g. temperature), utilities usage, etc.. \
No way I will give[ this data to Amazon](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/ring-cameras-may-someday-scan-license-plates-and-faces-leak-shows/) or[ Google Home Hub](https://screenrant.com/google-nest-xiaomi-camera-leak/)!
    23. **Home Security Cameras. **This is even more privacy sensitive. [Those cams listen and see](https://www.consumerreports.org/home-security-cameras/keep-home-security-cameras-from-being-hacked/). Even if deployed outside, at the door, they are creating an [unprecedented surveillance that we willingly subject ourselves to](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor).
    24. [Find my](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) phone / laptop, [Google’s find my device](https://www.google.com/android/find?u=0), [Tile](https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/tracking-tag), [Apple Tags](https://www.pocket-lint.com/gadgets/news/apple/149277-apple-tracking-device-everything-you-need-to-know), tags [for pets](https://www.idtag.com/), etc. Note: “By using the Find My Device service, you allow Google to use location data, device information, and connection events to locate your devices and accessories. Device location is approximate and may not always be accurate.”
9. **Productivity**
    25. Shared document editing, like Google docs. ([PushPin](https://automerge.github.io/pushpin/) and [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) are Open Source variants. PushPin is decentralized). 
    26. Shared spreadsheet editing ([Ethercalc](https://ethercalc.net/) is the Open Source variant)
    27. Document viewers / editors for Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.
    28. calendar
    29. email 
10. **Databases. **Tradle provides a built-in Explorer for operational data and automatic export to Cloud Data Lake for use by generic analysis tools. In addition, it provides an easy way for 3rd party apps to store structured data, initial data sets could be:
    30. Bank and credit card transactions 
    31. Income Taxes 
    32. E-health [FHIR-formatted](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) data (conditions, allergies, meds, labs, etc.)
11. **[Remem](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3431155345)**. Personal Search engine for all the web pages and articles the person read, all podcasts listened, videos watched, etc.
12. **Research and Data visualizations. **Take a look at [Observable](https://observablehq.com/ ) and imagine this applied to data in Personal Cloud, and to datasets shared between researchers.
13. **Your own website. **Your personal or professional site and blog need a place to run. This is it.
14. **Making money **where the owner's Personal Cloud joins a P2P network designed to generate rewards. Such networks are often coordinated by the blockchain and are enabled by blockchain-based micropayments. 
    33. **VPN node**. Each Personal Cloud owner may choose to run a VPN node to make some money. There is a new P2P [VPN Orchid](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-vpn-built-on-blockchain-could-be-the-next-step-in-privacy-tech/) that allows [anyone to launch a VPN node](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-enabled-vpn-provider-orchid-launches-on-apples-app-store) to earn money. 
    34. **Co-streaming**. P2P bandwidth-sharing [youtube alternatives](https://blockonomi.com/youtube-alternative/) are becoming popular as 4K video bandwidth is expensive for a single app developer to cover.
    35. Over time many similar smart contract-based orchestrations will emerge that allow individual nodes to make some money, one other example is [Livestream transcoding services](https://chainflow.io/livepeer-transcoder-and-orchestrator-financial-model/).
    36. **Co-hosting**. P2P storage-sharing for increased durability, load-balancing and mobility of content between providers.
    37. **Blockchain node**. And finally, some enthusiasts may choose to run a Blockchain Node, helping secure the network and earning fees. This is becoming possible today as new blockchains are switching to mining that does not waste energy, as in the case of Bitcoin.
15. **Dev tools. **Do It Yourself (DIY) tools for hobbyists to allow creation of unexpected currently new things.


## Commercial model 

Tradle Cloud App Store will have no 30% surcharge on app purchases, like in Apple and Google app stores - all revenues go to developers, but there are fees, like payment transactions, access to data: \




*   30% sur-charge on cloud compute resources utilised when Federated AI gets trained on Private Data in Personal Cloud.  \
_No data leaves Personal Cloud, only trained models._
*   Transaction fees for cloud resources exchange
*   Transaction fees in apps using Transaction Messenger


## IPM portfolio synergy 



1. Matches IPM investment thesis: Infra-tech
2. Complements IPM’s investment into [CPU startup Tachyum](https://www.tachyum.com/news), which targets the cloud market, especially its AI capabilities match Tradle’s Federated AI. 
3. Complements IPM investment into [InoBat](https://www.ipmllp.com/case-study/inobat/) and [Energy Storage Systems](https://www.ipmllp.com/case-study/energy-storage-systems-ess/) 


## Assembling the stack for multi-tenant deployments 

Please review the [Minimum Viable Cloud](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1968nfYSbsc5WItqQ-Sq94eeu0VKW7VY6SAz4tHWeBJg/edit) and [Data Centers evolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYZwqurI8i0I1Ui0PN9rKUkcG1hSW_bEsTDRWYmvroQ/edit) documents for background research. See detailed plan for R&D on assembling the [Simple Cloud stack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BeSegiJeQOIdioPCg8MNSmK1SvoJUA4qITgvuTXwnJw/edit#) for Tradle MyCloud to operate on top of general Linux in any Data Center.
