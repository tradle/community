This site was created using Docusaurus and is hosted on AWS S3.

We chose this solution as it converts markdown into html and generates the site from a couple of simple config files.

Head over to [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/) to learn more.
We also wanted a locally build search so used [this awesome plugin](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local) from [Shenwei Wang](https://github.com/weareoutman)
