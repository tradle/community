In the Cloud market today, AWS, Azure and GCP (so called Hyperscalers) rein, and like in the pre-PC era, the systems of Hyperscalers are incompatible, and the scale of independent Data Centers is too small to compete with the Hyperscalers.</p><p>What we are missing is the Uber for Data Centers. Tradle will unify Data Centers by helping them run Personal Cloud, a new market segment, not pursued by Hyperscalers. </p><p>Like MS DOS was for PCs and Android is for mobiles, Personal Cloud is the next cycle of Personal Computing. Combined with Uber-like marketplace to place Personal Cloud in one of the enabled data centers, it creates a ground for explosive growth. Every European citizen will get a Personal Cloud as an extension to their mobile phone. Personal Cloud will run Personal Apps that hold data in Europe, with data that <strong>can’t be accessed by anyone,</strong> but that person.</p><p><strong>Network effect</strong> is increasing with more Personal Clouds coming online for use by Federated AI. Network effect will also emerge as is common in any marketplace. </p><p><strong>Market conditions</strong> today are conducive for this market to emerge in Europe, as Europe is fighting to keep the data locally, in custody of EU companies.  \</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7b13372-3797-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4">EU is ramping up its efforts</a> to rein in the Big Tech</li><li>EU top court <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2020/07/16/european-top-court-strikes-down-key-eu-us-data-transfer-treaty-in-ruling-that-may-affect-us-tech-giants/#331f0b83c22a">struck down EU-US Data Transfer</a> agreement</li><li>Cloud is critical infrastructure, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-gaia-x-this-is-europes-bid-to-get-cloud-independence-from-us-and-china-giants/">EU GAIA-X declared independence</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Protection_Board">EDPB</a> says US CLOUD Act <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b8d58500-c25e-421a-91c6-7dbef3e4a2b8">contradicts Article 48 of the GDPR</a></li><li>EU Data Center market already greatly <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-data-center-market-in-europe-by-investment-to-around-44-billion-during-the-period-2020-2025---market-research-by-arizton-301025624.html">benefited from the GDPR</a></li><li>European culture of personal values and federated business </li></ol><p>Eastern Europe, starting with Slovakia, is poised to lead the Personal Cloud market.</p><p><strong>Conducive conditions in Slovakia</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2020/03/02/slovakia-wakes-up-to-a-new-era-without-fico/">Slovakia&#x27;s anti-corruption fight</a> is a match to Tradle’s blockchain Cloud e-government. </li><li>Slovakia’s new government has set sights on healthcare, a match for Personal Cloud.</li><li>Imagine every Slovak getting a Personal Cloud when accessing e-gov &amp; Telco services.</li><li><a href="https://datacentercatalog.com/slovakia">Slovakia can support its Data Centers</a> expansion with its <a href="https://www.seas.sk/slovak-energy-sector">robust supply of electricity</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.ipmllp.com/sectors/growth/">IPM’s infra-tech thesis</a> and portfolio are synergistic to the Personal Cloud proposition.</li></ul><p><strong>Market Beyond Europe: </strong>Due to the proliferation of Data Sovereignty / Residency laws, a similar market can emerge in Asia &amp; LATAM.</p><h3 id="achieving-scale">Achieving scale</h3><p>There were 500,000 commercial Data Centers worldwide in 2011, and they came under tough competition with the Hyperscalers.

It will take a number of years before hyperscalers are able to address that with the combination of building local Data Centers and Private Cloud, like AWS Outposts. Even then, the attitude of the market and the government is that the data will eventually end up in the US (due to Cloud Act) or China (due to outsized influence of Chinese government on Chinese Cloud providers: Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei). </p><h3 id="opportunity-of-data-privacy-regime">Opportunity of Data Privacy Regime</h3><p>Europe’s Data Regime is a competitive jurisdictional advantage for Personal Cloud. It is a unique opportunity for Europe to catch up and get ahead of US and Asian cloud providers. </p><p>This will give local data centers a unique competitive advantage. </p><p>This will attract new types of apps and allow the innovation ecosystem to flourish. </p><h3 id="network-effect-of-ai-on-personal-data">Network effect of AI on Personal Data</h3><p><strong>AI market size</strong>. The global artificial intelligence (AI) market size was valued at $27B in 2019 and is projected to reach <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/artificial-intelligence-market-100114">$266B by 2027, growing at 33.2%</a>. It is quickly rising to understand the world around us, like in eKYC, self-driving cars, <a href="https://readwrite.com/2020/03/15/decoding-the-future-trajectory-of-healthcare-with-ai/">healthcare</a>, <a href="https://www.spixii.com/blog/the-future-of-voice">human speech</a>. Just recently, AI, called GPT3, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential">read all of the World Wide Web</a> and showed it can answer search queries - a possible Google replacement in the future.</p><p><strong>AI is starved for data</strong>, as most data is not public and the rest is in the hands on Big Tech. </p><p>Hence independent AI developers lack data to train their models, which greatly limits the speed and the diversity of innovation. This can be addressed by Federated AI in Personal Cloud. Federated AI allows training models without centralizing data, and thus without letting developers see the data. Devs can pay on Cloud Market for their AI models to access data.</p><p><strong>Network effect</strong>. Personal Cloud democratizes AI, allowing AI startups to compete with Big Tech. As more Personal Clouds come online, AI models gain more data to train on, achieving unprecedented quality. </p><h3 id="immediate-danger-of-ai-and-big-tech">Immediate danger of AI and Big Tech</h3><p>Big Tech is dominating the AI market with billions of users’ records. By creating a visiting AI protocol on Personal Cloud, Tradle restores a fair competitive landscape. Europe’s Legal requirements for Data Protection (GDPR) and the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Data Residency</a> EU court ruling create a unique time-sensitive opportunity for local data AI.</p><h3 id="covid-19-supply-chain-restructuring">COVID-19 Supply Chain restructuring</h3><p>COVID-19 and US-China trade war have started the “bringing supply chains closer” shift.

This is how it will work - customer downloads the app, gets through eKYC and is then given access to cellular network. Along with it comes a <strong>free Personal Cloud</strong> with certain limits, e.g. 1M compute units and 5G storage. Commercially this is a freemium model used by Dropbox, Apple iCloud and others. At today’s storage costs $5 a month buys 250GB of s3. So, if only 1 out of 25 signs up for the premium Personal Cloud, the costs will be covered.</p><h3 id="e-government">e-government</h3><p>Give every citizen in one particular country, e.g. Slovakia (or Czechia, Croatia, etc.) a Personal Cloud, enabled with 5 initial e-government services. This creates a demand for cloud resources that can be purchased on the market. Initial suppliers could be 3-5 local data centers in that country. </p><h3 id="energy-companies">Energy companies</h3><p>Data Centers are their growing customer base. Due to this synergy, Energy companies can promote Personal Cloud, by offering a Tradle app as a mechanism for customers to track residential energy consumption, pay for these utilities, and use Utilities bill as an address confirmation for KYC with the financial sector and Telcos. Etc.</p><h3 id="schools-and-colleges">Schools and Colleges</h3><p>Students need a place to keep their data related to studies, issuing credentials, and exam results </p><h2 id="partners">Partners</h2><h3 id="commodities-exchange">Commodities Exchange</h3><p>Perhaps, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Exchange_Bratislava">Commodity Exchange in Slovakia</a></p><h3 id="linux-distribution">Linux Distribution</h3><p>Any independent Linux distribution is a potential partner. For example, Canonical. Canonical is the Ubuntu Linux Distribution vendor. Ubuntu is the most popular Linux in AWS but in the Startup market it is quickly losing ground to Amazon Linux (used in AWS Lambda and Fargate) and to Red Hat in the Enterprise market. Canonical needs a new playbook. </p><h2 id="cloud-apps">Cloud Apps</h2><p><strong>Unlike mobile and web apps today, Personal Cloud Apps return to the privacy model of the PC era - you keep your data to yourself. </strong></p><h3 id="cloud-apps-extend-mobile-and-web-apps-with-unique-capabilities">Cloud Apps extend mobile (and web) apps with unique capabilities</h3><p>Apps are complementary to mobile apps, leveraging Cloud’s strength: \</p><ol><li><strong>No power constraints</strong>, while mobiles need to carefully battery, and be recharged</li><li><strong>Unlimited and reliable storage</strong>, a constant issue on mobiles.</li><li><strong>Always-on</strong>. Cloud is always up and running, while mobile can be out of juice, not connected, web apps go away when tab closes or PC goes to sleep (e.g. laptop lid is closed). A whole class of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=local-first-apps">local-first apps</a> can’t be built without it.

Developed world has an enormous problem with <a href="https://www.longevityinternational.org/appglongevity">shrinking and aging populations</a>. In the European Union, the working-age population is projected to fall from <strong>333 million</strong> in 2016 to <strong><a href="https://www.icf.com/insights/social-programs/aging-population-in-europe">292 million in 2070</a></strong>. Meanwhile, the share of people aged 65 and over will rise from 19% to 29% of the population, and people aged 80 and over will increase from 5% to 13%. A number of biotech breakthroughs are promising an increased healthspan. To facilitate we can start with the following apps:
14. Clinical trials protocol development and compliance
15. Clinical trials participants recruitment
16. e-consultation with doctors (chat and video calls)
17. Feedback loops:
4. At-home lab tests (DNA, saliva, blood, urine)
5. Body monitoring: blood pressure, blood oxygen, EKG, glucose, sleep, activity, <a href="https://transmitter.ieee.org/electronic-nose-technology/">odors</a>, and other measurements
6. Analyze and alert to abnormalities
7. Dietary and supplementation monitoring
8. Exercising and meditation
18. Links to <em>vitamins and supplements</em> related to “my results”</li><li><strong>Voice assistants</strong> like Alexa, Siri are extremely popular. Yet they are especially privacy sensitive. They are listening to all we say inside our homes, and may send all that data to their vendor, often outside of country borders.  \
We will use Open Source that is easily verifiable, like <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/6/mycroft">MyCroft</a> and <a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/firefox-voice/">Firefox Voice</a>. Specialized Assistants are usually better, as Alexa has shown. Assistants are good for these industries:
19. Hospitality
20. Legal, see <a href="https://donotpay.com/">an example</a>.</li><li><strong>Monitoring and tracking. </strong>If not done via a Personal Cloud it creates a possibility for mass surveillance. Commercially, this is a new base for the Home, Health, Life, Vehicle <strong>Insurance</strong>.
21. <strong>Fitness trackers. </strong>
22. <strong>Home and car</strong>. Automation and data for door lock, in-home and in-car video surveillance, sensors (e.g. temperature), utilities usage, etc.. \
No way I will give<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/ring-cameras-may-someday-scan-license-plates-and-faces-leak-shows/"> this data to Amazon</a> or<a href="https://screenrant.com/google-nest-xiaomi-camera-leak/"> Google Home Hub</a>!
23. <strong>Home Security Cameras. </strong>This is even more privacy sensitive. <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-security-cameras/keep-home-security-cameras-from-being-hacked/">Those cams listen and see</a>. Even if deployed outside, at the door, they are creating an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor">unprecedented surveillance that we willingly subject ourselves to</a>.

Such networks are often coordinated by the blockchain and are enabled by blockchain-based micropayments.
33. <strong>VPN node</strong>. Each Personal Cloud owner may choose to run a VPN node to make some money. There is a new P2P <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/this-vpn-built-on-blockchain-could-be-the-next-step-in-privacy-tech/">VPN Orchid</a> that allows <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-enabled-vpn-provider-orchid-launches-on-apples-app-store">anyone to launch a VPN node</a> to earn money.
34. <strong>Co-streaming</strong>. P2P bandwidth-sharing <a href="https://blockonomi.com/youtube-alternative/">youtube alternatives</a> are becoming popular as 4K video bandwidth is expensive for a single app developer to cover.
35. Over time many similar smart contract-based orchestrations will emerge that allow individual nodes to make some money, one other example is <a href="https://chainflow.io/livepeer-transcoder-and-orchestrator-financial-model/">Livestream transcoding services</a>.
36. <strong>Co-hosting</strong>. P2P storage-sharing for increased durability, load-balancing and mobility of content between providers.
37. <strong>Blockchain node</strong>. And finally, some enthusiasts may choose to run a Blockchain Node, helping secure the network and earning fees. This is becoming possible today as new blockchains are switching to mining that does not waste energy, as in the case of Bitcoin.</li><li><strong>Dev tools. </strong>Do It Yourself (DIY) tools for hobbyists to allow creation of unexpected currently new things.</li></ol><h2 id="commercial-model">Commercial model</h2><p>Tradle Cloud App Store will have no 30% surcharge on app purchases, like in Apple and Google app stores - all revenues go to developers, but there are fees, like payment transactions, access to data: \</p><ul><li>30% sur-charge on cloud compute resources utilised when Federated AI gets trained on Private Data in Personal Cloud.  \
