You can view key-value store as a simplest possible database and it is a common component in modern applications, and especially as embedded part of P2P applications. E.g. Ethereum uses KV store for <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/getting-deep-into-ethereum-how-data-is-stored-in-ethereum-e3f669d96033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smart-contract storage</a>.</li><li><strong>Hyperbee</strong>, a key-value store, that also provides sorted range queries and therefore can be used by the database on top to build indexes.</li><li><strong>Corestore</strong>, to managing many Hypercores you typically end up authoring or replicating from others.</li><li><strong>Hyperdrive</strong>, a P2P alternative to Google Drive and Dropbox</li><li><strong>Hyperswarm</strong>, a discovery mechanism for connecting to peers (sort of a decentralized DNS)</li><li><strong>Beaker Browser</strong>, a full-blown browser that also supports the Web without servers (P2P Web).</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="what-is-the-usp-unique-selling-proposition-of-hypercore"></a>What is the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of Hypercore?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-usp-unique-selling-proposition-of-hypercore" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Hypercore is Open Source, it is not selling :-), but it is offering itself to developers. So what is it that is absolutely unique about it? Hypercore is P2P technology, but we saw other P2P technologies, BitTorrent and Bitcoin. What is unique about Hypercore?</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="streaming"></a>Streaming<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#streaming" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Hypercore&#x27;s key USP is <strong>streaming</strong>. You can think of it as video streaming, but now for videos and also filesystems, databases, messages, IoT signals, and any other structured data constructs. With streaming, you get:</p><ul><li><strong>Almost immediate access</strong>, even though the data is not yet fully downloaded or may never need to be fully downloaded</li><li><strong>Higher security</strong>, as it provides the integrity and authentication guarantees for each data element on the wire. This is huge! A typical database, file and messaging servers stake their security on the initial connection establishment and protecting communications on the wire. But normally they do not guard against a compromised or fraudulent peer, while Hypercore does. Our evolution in this area of security needs to always examine data from remote peers in view of the potential risk and the probability of fraud.</li><li><strong>Higher scalability</strong>, as you can shove your streaming database in S3 and let billion people use it.</li></ul><p>This streaming point needs to be repeated again and again, as streaming data, just by itself, without any other wonderful Hypercore capabilities, may create a new class of applications, much like Netflix re-invented the movie watching. This paradigm shift is one reason why Hypercore is hard to grok for app developers, it just requires full rethinking of our current architectures.</p><p>Note, when reading Hypercore docs you will find many references to sparse replication. This is the capability used for streaming, allowing a peer to efficiently request individual blocks from remote peers, instead of loading the whole remote dataset, be it a video file or a database.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="lego-blocks-for-constructing-distributed-apps"></a>Lego blocks for constructing distributed apps<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#lego-blocks-for-constructing-distributed-apps" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Another USP of Hypercore is that it implements essential patterns of distributed systems in a reusable way, so that systems and applications are not forced to re-invent the wheel.</p><p><strong>WAL</strong>. All distributed systems need a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/wal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Write Ahead Log (WAL)</a>, be it databases, orchestration engines, like Zookeeper or etcd, or event streaming systems like Kafka. Every system implements its own WAL today. Hypercore generalized this pattern as an append-only-log and consistently uses it in its higher-level data structures such as Hypertrie, Hyperbee, Hyperdrive.</p><p><strong>Time travel</strong>. Hypercore provides universal history for all data structures which work on top of it, which gives them a universal undo-redo, rewind-replay. This capability is common in editors, but now it can be used in any application including retracing actions in a filesystem and a database. Use cases are plentiful:</p><ul><li><a href="https://elm-lang.org/news/time-travel-made-easy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time-travel debugging</a></li><li>for reactive applications (React, <a href="https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs#more-on-stores" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reflux</a>)</li><li>customer support (to replay user actions)</li><li>building a test suite that starts from different checkpoints playing out many scenarios</li><li>forensic investigations</li><li>playing out what-if business scenarios</li><li>to support blockchain reorg in a full node</li><li>for performing risky operations, knowing you can come back to a starting point </li><li>a million other use cases, all with one simple abstraction, that all users already know and love</li></ul><p><strong>Recovery</strong> Same history capability can be used for classic database point-in-time recovery, DB and filesystem snapshots, and versioning for data integrity assurance, VM snapshots, filesystem and DB snapshots, container image layers, etc. etc.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="real-time-ui-updates"></a>Real-time UI updates<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#real-time-ui-updates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>We have gotten used to how Gmail automatically refreshes UI when new email arrives or when you view email on mobile, and it is marked as read now. This capability is pervasively used by Google in Docs, Slides, and other apps. Distributed apps need to match that and Hypercore&#x27;s real-time updates, including on changes on other devices or by our teammates, provides us with this capability.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="large-file-handling"></a>Large file handling<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#large-file-handling" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Many applications (like chat, group chat, photo apps, social media apps and collaborative apps) need an ability to handle file sync, especially for very large media files. Those providers hold large files in the central holding area, and we never really know of they delete them afterwards, potentially violating our privacy. They also have significant limits on file sizes. Hypercore is geared really well to enable these scenarios without a central server / provider and without limits. And on top of this it adds partial sync or streaming, so data do not need to be loaded fully to be viewed / explored.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="bottom-line-on-usp"></a>Bottom line on USP<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#bottom-line-on-usp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Distributed apps need these and therefore apps using hypercore become simpler to write.</p><p>Need help with this:
How would one implement in Hypercore forwarding a message with a large video from one chat to another (both in a one-on-one and a group chat).</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="what-is-offline-first-local-first-software"></a>What is offline-first local-first software?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-offline-first-local-first-software" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Take a look at <a href="https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/in-search-of-a-local-first-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared Forsyth&#x27;s criteria</a> for the above and the various products he reviewed using these criteria. The framework for this type of software is very hard to create, but it is a fresh direction away from massive aggregation of our personal data, and it is close to become a reality. Isn&#x27;t it why you are here?</p><p>Hypercore is built to give you full control of your data. This means, it continues to work even when you have no connectivity, when your other peers are offline, and when hosting / cloud provider closes your account. It also allows portability to other machines or hosting providers.</p><p>Note for example, that Google Docs only has support for offline work in Chrome, but not in other browsers. This is how these services tie you up. The new phenomenon is de-platforming, when app provider, like Twitter closes your account, or App Store blocks your app downloads. Facebook and Twitter famously killed rich ecosystems of apps on their platforms.</p><p>By relying on providers without a mobility we give up on self-sovereignty and core freedoms and become slaves of the platforms, morphing our behavior to their demands, and facilitating creation of mass surveillance systems, like happened with WeChat and other platforms in China.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="what-is-a-streaming-db"></a>What is a streaming DB?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-streaming-db" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There is a new hot area in Big Data world for querying static databases. In AWS it is Athena, based on Apache Presto engine, and SQL SELECT. CSV Files (or files in JSON, Parquet, ORC, Avro formats) are shoved into S3 and then queried by Serverless applications and by Business Intelligence packages like Tableau.</p><p>This requires no databases servers and shows where Hyperbee can be very useful. </p><p>What other applications that can we think of that can be enabled by such a server-less DB, a DB that redefines how querying is done (via sparse data propagation), a DB that embeds a replication mechanism?</p><p>Some pointers to possible answers can be found when we compare a P2P source control system Git that replaced SVN and CVS which used central server. Those entrepreneurs that think &quot;Is it possible to make a big business on this?&quot;, please note that Microsoft bought Github for $7.5B.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="how-is-hypercore-different-from-bittorrent-webtorrent"></a>How is Hypercore different from BitTorrent, WebTorrent?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#how-is-hypercore-different-from-bittorrent-webtorrent" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>BitTorrent</strong>. Hypercore can do what BitTorrent does and more. Hypercore can do discovery and accelerated file download with bandwidth-sharing like BitTorrent, that is, the more viewers watch, the better it works.</p><p>But Hypercore can do more - it is built as a data and communications framework for modern decentralized applications.</p><ol><li>Applications need data structures. Hypercore provides append-only log, Hypertrie key-value store, Hyperbee database and Hyperdrive filesystem.</li><li>Hypercore support data editing as a design principle. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17306106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitTorrent enhancement BEP 46</a> exists for updating files, but it does not allow updating a record in a database, so is not suitable for applications.</li><li>It provides full data add/edit version history which allows auditing, point-in-time-recovery, and state snapshots.</li><li>It provides sparse download like BitTorrent, but extends it to databases.</li><li>Hypercore has data access authentication.</li><li>Hypercore has network encryption.</li></ol><p><strong>WebTorrent</strong>. WebTorrent is awesome, it pioneered BitTorrent in browsers and its is a great success, but its mission statement was just that, a BitTorrent for the Web.</p><p>Note that WebTorrent&#x27;s tech can be helpful to Hypercore, as it perfected peer discovery (via DHT) on the Web and it allowed a number of innovative streaming clients to emerge, which could be helpful for Hypercore applications, like Beaker Browser.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="how-is-hypercore-different-from-scuttlebutt-ssb"></a>How is Hypercore different from ScuttleButt (SSB)?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#how-is-hypercore-different-from-scuttlebutt-ssb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>SSB is a peer-to-peer network for streaming feeds of JSON objects. Its primary data-structure is the &quot;feed.&quot;</li><li>SSB is not suited for streaming, as it does not have a sparse data structure (enabled in Hypercore by Merkle trees, while SSB uses linked lists).</li><li>SSB uses a gossip protocol to sync data between peers. It does not automate peer discovery for a given dataset (e.g. via DHT) so topology must be manually managed. Hypercore uses a DHT to automate discovery of peers for exchanging of data.</li><li>SSB is primarily focused on social media applications. Hypercore has been growing towards a more generic model of structured data (file systems, databases) spread and synchronized over many devices.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="how-is-hypercore-different-from-ipfs"></a>How is Hypercore different from IPFS?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#how-is-hypercore-different-from-ipfs" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Both are cool open source P2P data projects that have existed for roughly the same 5-7 years.</p><p>You can review Reddit discussion that makes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipfs/comments/glnra9/hypercore_protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some good points</a>.</p><p>Some key differences, <a href="https://www.datprotocol.com/deps/0002-hypercore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described here</a>, are:</p><ul><li><p>Mutability. From the start IPFS was designed as an immutable storage, while Hypercore was designed as a mutable storage. In Hypercore editable content was a prime design objective, supported by the internal data structures, its protocol, Change Data Capture system, APIs, etc.</p></li><li><p>Discovery. Both IPFS and Hypercore use DHT for discovery nowadays. This allows avoiding dependency on a more centralized DNS system. But they use DHT very differently. IPFS is more like BitTorrent, puts individual file reference in DHT, specifically the hash of file&#x27;s contents (content-addressed). Since hash changes with file modifications, IPFS added a naming system <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/#example-ipns-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPNS</a> so that the name in IPNS points to the file&#x27;s latest version&#x27;s hash. In Hypercore discovery is at higher level, to avoid overloading DHT. By default, the whole drives (Hyperdrives with potentially millions of files) are addressed via the DHT, URL of the file becomes drive/file. In addition, Hyperswarm service provides a flexible mechanism to design your own DHT-based discovery system, e.g. discover communities, teams, people, etc.</p></li><li><p>Directory structures and file metadata. IPFS simulates directories by creating files with links to other files. Hypercore does full file system emulation and therefore can be mounted natively (via FUSE) to be viewed in File Explorer, Finder and to be used from the command line as a normal file system.</p></li><li><p>File metadata. </p></li><li><p>Neither <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/#example-ipns-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPNS</a> nor Hypercore&#x27;s Beaker URL have human-friendly addresses.</p></li></ul><p>Some notes on IPFS goodies:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.infura.io/an-introduction-to-ipfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPNS has has captured imagination of Ethereum community</a> to build fully decentralized apps, as most blockchain apps today still keep data and processing centralized.</li><li>IPFS project has produced solid core libraries, like libp2p, solving many of the same issues as Hypercore&#x27;s Hyperswarm.</li><li>IPFS has implementations in a number of languages, while Hypercore is only in JavaScript. Rust implementation was recently started and hopefully will lead to overall health of Hypercore, forcing better documented specs and more test-suits.</li><li>IPFS team runs a number of public servers that help make the network more usable.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="more-work-needed-to-compare-ipfs-and-hypercore"></a>more work needed to compare IPFS and Hypercore<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#more-work-needed-to-compare-ipfs-and-hypercore" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Review these and structure its content for summary below:

So what gives, if it is so amazing, and it is! Here is my take, aside from a general statement that making a P2P framework work smoothly is super-hard:</p><p>Many P2P apps struggle as they lack availability, durability and work in the unforgiving networking environments.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>. For example, in a P2P collaborative editing app competing with Google Docs, once you close your laptop, your collaborators can&#x27;t get your latest content, unless they were online when you made edits. With Google Docs, if you had a connection at the time of the last edit, the changes are available to others, even if you went offline right after. This is especially important for team work across the timezones. So some master nodes that &quot;seed&quot; the content are always needed in P2P applications (e.g. Hashbase), but these so called super-nodes often re-centralize things and introduce challenges for permissioning, data sovereignty, and data privacy. Availability problem remains unsolved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Durability</strong>. We are spoiled with Google (and others) taking care of preserving our content. We pay a steep price of giving them everything on us, but this convenience is very hard to achieve in P2P world. Your peers may be good friends but there is no guarantee they will not lose your precious content. Many solutions are being tried, including those with Cryptocurrencies incentivizing users to keep content, but they all have technical and convenience frictions. Besides, who wants to be responsible for disseminating a potentially illegal content? Durability problem remains unsolved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Networking</strong>. Current Internet, with its routing and firewalling system is just hostile to P2P connections. Although Hypercore&#x27;s Hyperswarm offers an ingenious NAT hole punching, there are too many edge cases, when it does not work on mobiles, it needs workarounds in browsers and is often blocked by VPNs and corporate firewalls. This does not mean it can&#x27;t be used, we just need a fallback to a trusted server acting as a proxy. But this comes at the same price of decentralization. Besides, if the user wants to send data to someone else, both devices need to be online simultaneously.</p></li></ul><p>Reliable P2P networking <strong>remains unsolved</strong>.</p><p>Is there an answer to those perpetual problems of P2P? We believe there is. In crypto world the answer was found with the notion of miners. This is why some P2P projects are attempting to repeat this approach introducing their own blockchains. IPFS team&#x27;s Filecoin, Storj, Theta.tv and a number of others are examples. But they are all focused on data storage.</p><p>Hypercore is so much more. It is a foundation for apps, it is made for storage, content distribution, messaging, decentralized databases, etc. And it feels like it is a good match for analytics and AI as well (more on that later).</p><p>Perhaps the answer to perpetual P2P reliability problems is not in copying the blockchain&#x27;s mining model or offering crypto-incentives to host files. Maybe the answer is orthogonal, instead of looking to incentivize third-parties to keep our files, we could do it ourselves, with a free and always-available cloud peer, a companion to the sometimes-available personal devices peers.</p><p>Viewed this way, cloud peer is not a hosting provider, it is just a different type of a personal device. It does does not have a screen, but it is capable in a different way, it complements our other personal devices with its 100% availability, a durable storage and elastic / expandable compute and data store.</p><p>Taking it a step further, the cloud peer could be a place to run many Hypercore apps that can&#x27;t run on personal devices. Think cloud app store, unencumbered by the domineering Apple and Google app stores.</p><p>This will make Hypercore shine!</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="what-is-the-state-of-p2p-and-its-evolution"></a>What is the state of P2P and its evolution?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-state-of-p2p-and-its-evolution" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Both classes of P2P systems, blockchains and P2P data are nudging towards mass market adoption. Cryptocurrencies made huge strides in creating a new foundation for global financial system, especially evidenced by the rise of DeFi in 2020.</p><p>In addition, many new projects are employing tokens as incentives mechanisms to avoid points of centralization that exist today. Examples are VPN (Orchid), Routing (PKT + CJDNS), social media (Steam), live streaming (Theta.tv), Web Browsing (Brave), Storage (StorJ, IPFS FileCoin). Several high-profile projects were shut down (Telegram TON) or have hit high resistance from governments (Facebook Libra).</p><p>Crypto-currency P2P projects are a huge step ahead of data-centric P2P projects like Hypercore and IPFS, as they have found their native hosting model, in the form of miners. This makes them independent of the Cloud providers, which is essential for their survivability in the face of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>P2P Data projects do not experience such a resistance, but they have not invented their own sustainable infrastructure. IPFS is looking to Filecoin to incentivize storage providers, while meanwhile subsidizing hosting via ipfs.io.</p><p>Hypercore community has produced Hashbase, Homebase, DatDot and other hosting solutions, but they have not reached significant maturity and adoption. Personal cloud peer could be an alternative to the aggregated hosting model.</p><p>Almost every P2P project is still largely held back by numerous overlapping infrastructure needs for this novel tech to hit a wider market. E.g. one common problem is the management of the ownership keys.</p><p>The difference between Hypercore and IPFS is that it has moved relatively slowly with its marketing. The core team chose to patiently and somewhat stealthily build the foundational technology and avoid starting the &quot;hype cycle&quot;, that is until it is ready for prime time. Initial releases of Hypercore (then called &quot;Dat&quot;) in 2016-2018 had scaling issues, which have been addressed by subsequent releases.</p><p>Specifically, Hypercore team focused on the performance of its unique &quot;streaming database&quot; design (see below). Team prepares for marketing push at the end of this year (2020), starting with the Beaker ecosystem (Beaker is the Web and P2P Browser and authoring platform built on Hypercore)</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="who-is-using-hypercore-p2p-framework-today"></a>Who is using Hypercore P2P framework today?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#who-is-using-hypercore-p2p-framework-today" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Need help with this.</p><p>Partial answer is:</p><p>Each project building on Hypercore is stretching its flexibility and contributes back solutions that are not yet available in the core.

For that it uses a Merkle tree hashing into it each block that is added to the append-only log.  On every change the root of the Merkle tree is signed by the private key of the of this Hypercore (note that this also creates a limitation of a single writer, see later how it is overcome). When Hypercore is shared to another peer, with the help of Merkle branches it is possible to to prove authenticity and integrity of a subset of blocks, without sharing the whole Hypercore. This allows to accept partial data from the untrusted peers (as they can&#x27;t fudge the data). This capability supports a number of potential use cases, like distributed caching and CDNs, bandwidth sharing, distributed files systems, streaming databases, audit trails and supervision protocols, etc. See an <a href="https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/bamboo/issues/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting discussion</a> in which Hypercore integrity guarantees were challenged and defended. </p><p>Append-only log also allows to recover the state of Hypercore at any prior a point-in-time, a highly desirable function in databases. It allows to preserve Hypercore backup snapshots at a particular point in time.</p><p>In addition, Hypercore supports versioning of data elements, a capability highly sought after in enterprise systems. Versioning allows protect data from accidental overwrite by a human being or a broken or malicious program. It also provides auditability and regulatory compliance.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="can-hypercores-author-change-history"></a>Can Hypercore&#x27;s author change history?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#can-hypercores-author-change-history" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>An actor could decide to revert Hypercore to a previous state, and share this fork. This could also be used in the attack where attacker aims for the initial data gets to either get deleted or destroyed by backups. Another possibility is for the author to rewind and serve different version of the history to different peers. See a <a href="https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions?at=5d9d962e973587467320b241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community discussion on this subject</a>.</p><p>The required protection can be achieved by sealing Hypercore&#x27;s root on public blockchain, utilizing its immutability and secure timestamping properties. Hypercore also does not guarantee long-term write-once storage. See explanation how audit trails benefit from <a href="https://techblog.bozho.net/audit-trail-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such services added on top</a>.</p><p>As Hypercore signing key is rotated with <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore-multi-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-key</a>, we need a proof that the new key is a valid successor from the old one. Different applications might use different algorithms for such a transition, and recipients of hypercore need a way to verify the code for this algorithm was not altered and was executed properly, but without running the code themselves. Smart contracts is one way of doing this, and Zero Knowledge provable computation is an <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/hello-cairo-3cb43b13b209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerging new option</a>.</p><p>Why can&#x27;t recipients run the code themselves, like they do when verifying Merkle tree and signature in Hypercore today? Because the key rotation algorithm may involve processes that recipient can&#x27;t repeat, like contacting a 3rd party for key recovery, or not having access to some private data that was used by the algorithm&#x27;s code, but can&#x27;t be shared.

Formal schema is defined by <a href="https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyp/blob/master/proposals/0002-hyper-url.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this specification</a>.

Now, should the author, by mistake or intentionally, rewind their hypercore to <code>version - 1</code> or earlier, and fill it with different data, the hash of the hypercore at <code>version</code> will be different and it will now not match the hash given in the URL.</p><p>Note that the hypercore can and will continue to be appended to after the point referred to in the URL. This is normal and fine, and URL will continue to work, referring to a particular point-in-time in data history. But it does not mean that the strong URL creates an obligation for the author not to rewind the hypercore.

Other transport protocols create connection establishment delays (extra round-trips), which make DHT too slow to be practical. Delegation to signaling servers challenges privacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Corporate firewalls may block UDP</strong>. Although the hope arises with QUIC / HTTP/3 gaining traction as it is using UDP on TLS port 443.</p></li><li><p><strong>No peer discovery on Cell Phone networks</strong>. Cellphone networks employ symmetric firewalls that block direct P2P connections (although UDP works, NAT hole punching does not). This affects mobile apps and PCs on HotSpots. With 5G proliferation, more applications operate on cell networks, making progress for direct P2P connections unlikely.</p></li><li><p><strong>DHT state needs stability</strong>. Peers that come and go (browser tabs) lose DHT state and need to recreate it (although this can be overcome with caching state in browser&#x27;s database).

This allows to find and establish direct connections to peers. In that way it serves as a P2P variant of DNS. Like DNS it provides network location independence. Like DNS it allows to store small data in location records. Unlike DNS it does not require any configuration. So it is well suited for non-technical users. Unlike DNS it does not depend on a service provider - it is fully decentralized. Actually there is still a dependency on a  list of bootstrap servers, but they are not fixed, like DNS root servers, and any Hyperswarm peer can bootstrap from the bootstrap servers it trusts (see <a href="https://github.com/hyperswarm/hyperswarm#swarm--hyperswarmoptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bootstrap</a>).</li></ul><p>To be precise, DNS system has another function which Hyperswarm does not replace. DNS is providing a friendly recognizable name for the IP address. We register today this so called domain name via some domain registrar, which is a commercial entity that is working with the root registrar (.com, .io) to rent domain names. This part is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very hard to decentralize</a>. DHT does not help here. Namecoin was the first to solve Zooko triangle puzzle, and <a href="https://docs.ens.domains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum ENS smart contract</a> is now well on the way to be adopted as a decentralized solution for this problem.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Avoid central signaling servers</strong>. For example, a <a href="https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1248744869419458561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video chat over WebRTC</a> requires a <a href="https://www.callstats.io/blog/2017/10/26/webrtc-product-turn-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STUN server</a> but with Hyperswarm it is avoided, increasing privacy and avoiding dependency on service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect to peers sitting behind a firewall</strong>, such as home routers, which otherwise can&#x27;t otherwise connect directly to each other. This can be used for video chats or any other P2P traffic (Hyperswarm&#x27;s huge value here is so called NAT hole punching, the algorithm is in <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/dht-rpc/blob/master/lib/io.js#L47-L68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DHT-RPC package</a>).

Once you write your first Hyperswarm and print all the new peers joining it, you will likely notice all kinds of peers that have nothing to do with you. Who are they? For a website and public media like Twitter or YouTube-style application, it is totally fine. But in a security-focused application you might get concerned.</p><p>Any hypercore-savvy person will argue that this is ok, as you will not be sharing any data.

Hyperswarm announces IP and Port of the peer to allow other peers in P2P network to connect with them. Hyperswarm&#x27;s DHT holds that data, so any observer could simply collect this information. The observer will also learn the topic this peer is advertizing. Aside from that no other information is leaked. Is it worse than DNS? In DNS servers also announce their name and address to the world. But clients do not, while in Hyperswarm they do. On the other hand, topic name is more private than in DNS, it is just some hash, not a human-readable name.</p><p>So what can be done to protect IP addresses in DHT?</p><ul><li><p>Hyperswarm can be improved to encrypt data in DHT, and this way only the peers that know some shared secret could find each other.</p></li><li><p>Potentially <a href="https://dat.discourse.group/t/feature-support-i2p/62/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I2P</a> can be used in the future.</p></li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="is-hyperswarm-susceptible-to-ddos"></a>Is Hyperswarm susceptible to DDOS?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#is-hyperswarm-susceptible-to-ddos" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><a href="https://pfrazee.hashbase.io/blog/hyperswarm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes</a>.

This means only one private key can have access to write into it. In other words it is a single-writer module. The advantage of single-writer is a strong verifiable integrity, audit trail, support for streaming, and many others.</p><p>But when hypercore is replicated to personal devices (phone, tablet, PC, cloud peers) each device needs to have its own private key, which means now multiple writers need to write into hypercore data structures. Same need arises when you want to collaborate with peers, with shared documents, files and databases, as you want peers to <strong>edit</strong> same objects and <strong>search</strong> across them.</p><p>To support such use cases multi-writer modules can be composed on top.</p><p>*Note that supporting multi-writer in core modules <a href="https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyperdrive/issues/230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been requested many times</a> but it turns out one size does not fit all. <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HyperDB</a> is an abandoned multi-writer database that became too complex as it tried to provide discovery, networking, authorization, conflict resolution, etc. in one package, serving many masters and satisfying none.** </p><p>So simple compositions, that are themselves composable is a better approach, see below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/RangerMauve/multi-hyperdrive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-hyperdrive</a>.

Yet because of the loss of connectivity changes made on each device may need to be merged. This includes documents, filesystems and databases.</p><p>In distributed systems, of which P2P is a subclass, reaching the same state is a hard problem with a long history. The reason it is hard was only recently formally described as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAP theorem</a>. The holy grail of distributed systems is to reach the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACID</a> guarantees of SQL databases - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. But SQL databases mostly operated on a single machine or on a closely managed cluster. Over the Internet the connectivity can be spotty and malicious actors abound.</p><p>  Handling bad actors became a specialty of blockchains, and it was a huge win for the P2P movement. Yet, since blockchains serve as shared databases for the whole world, they come with limitations. They have high transaction costs, low throughput, can store only the miniscule amounts of data, and can&#x27;t hold or process private data. To overcome these limitations some applications re-centralize, adding web servers, application servers and DB servers. Others try to remain pure P2P by using IPFS or Hypercore.</p><p>Algorithms, that tackle bad connections, <strong>but not bad actors</strong> have evolved from the highly complex Paxos to a simpler RAFT, to PBFT, and finally, in the last 5-7 years, to CRDT. CRTD is very lightweight and allows to operate leaderless multi-master, allowing each master to merging edits on the edge without any central coordination. This means no operators to run central service (Zookeeper, etcd, etc.) and handle complex cluster failure modes. Note that CRDT is quietly being used by AWS DynamoDB and Azure Cosmos - and if it is good enough for those web-scale databases, it is good enough for P2P.</p><p>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5NULPSiOGw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great introductory talk</a> on CRDT and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMVBuMK_pJY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advanced one</a>. </p><p>For NodeJS the prime candidate is <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automerge</a>, but there are others like <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/peer-base/js-delta-crdts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta-CRDT</a> (please share if you know a better one). CRDT is used by OrbitDB that runs on top of IPFS.</p><p>CRDT matches perfectly multi-device and collaborative editing use cases of P2P:</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="databases"></a>Databases<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#databases" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>CRDT provides new data types with <strong>magic properties</strong> that allow automatic merging of independent edits. Anyone who sent Word documents by email to their teammates or lawyers knows the &quot;joys&quot; of redlining. Any developer knows the chores of merging conflicts that Git could not auto-merge. Good news for the humankind, no more conflicts with CRDT. But it also means that we need to adapt our databases to keep history of changes, sequence them properly, use stable IDs of our peers and coordinate clocks. Hypercore multi-writer modules will incorporate CRDTs for this by the end of 2020.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="collaborative-editing"></a>Collaborative editing<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#collaborative-editing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>P2P needs a mechanism to match Google Docs (and Slides, Sheets, Diagrams, etc.) that allow multiple people edit the same document simultaneously. Google Docs uses an older Operational Transforms algorithm that is highly complex and allows only 2 concurrent edits (which Google overcomes by having a central server quietly merging in the background). A special branch of CRDT for sequences (LSEQ is one of them) was developed recently. Hypercore multi-writer modules will incorporate CRDTs for this by Q1 2021.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="crdt-and-cloud-peers"></a>CRDT and cloud peers<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#crdt-and-cloud-peers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Personal cloud &quot;device&quot; is always on. This resolves a common P2P issue when you edited a document, closes your laptop or an app on the phone. Cloud peer can make your changes available for others. But consensus still need to be reached and without a Google in the middle.</p><ul><li>CRDT allows multiple cloud peers to sync with other devices and sync between themselves</li><li>An always-on cloud peer allows CRDT to merge edits from multiple devices in real-time, so that conflicting edits don&#x27;t accumulate, matching Google experience but without Google reading all our documents.</li></ul><p>Note that CRDT resolution works smoother when clocks between machines are well synchronized. NTP existed for years, and now there is a new iteration <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-cfnts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NTS, published by Cloudflare</a>.
